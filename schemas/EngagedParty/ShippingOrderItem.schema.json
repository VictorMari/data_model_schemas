The structure identifies the system itself, the nature of the entity within the system (e.g. class name) and the unique ID of the entity within the system. It is anticipated that multiple external IDs can be held for a single entity, e.g. if the entity passed through multiple systems on the way to the current system. In this case the consumer is expected to sequence the IDs in the array in reverse order of provenance, i.e. most recent system first in the list.",
